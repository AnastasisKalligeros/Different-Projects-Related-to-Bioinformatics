# Different-Projects-Related-to-Bioinformatics

A group project that was developed as a university assignment for the subject "Bioinformatics". The application was implemented in python and as a development tool Visual Studio Code was chosen. Phylogenetic analyses were carried out using the MEGA softwarε, the most likely sequence of states (a/b) for the GGCT sequence was decoded. Logarithmic scores were used instead of normal probability scores, implemented the game two "chromosomes" that of length n and m nucleotides respectively. In each round of game, one player can destroy one of the chromosome and divide the other into two non-empty parts. The player who deletes the last nucleotide wins. Finally, with the help of the Chimera-X software and the database for the object we studied, we obtained the necessary information for the first 2 questions about the protein base. For the remaining 3 questions we used the software mentioned before. </br> </br>
